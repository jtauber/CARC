  While there has been digital humanities work on old code, I’m not aware of
  any straight up application of corpus linguistic approaches to its study.
</p>

<p>
  The idea for this project came about when I read a discussion of whether
  <code>LDA</code> was the most common 6502 instruction and it occurred to me that this,
  along with a lot of subtleties, is a very “corpus linguistics” question to
  ask.
</p>

<p>
  The acronym is a Tolkien reference, “Carc” being a legendary raven from the
  past in <cite>The Hobbit</cite>.

    <h1>Sector Types in the Apple II Disk Corpus</h1>

      <p>A regular Apple II floppy disk has 560 sectors of 256 bytes.
Across the 12,450 disks in the current corpus, that’s <strong>6,972,000</strong> sectors.
How many unique sector <strong>types</strong> are there and what are the most common?</p>
<p>There are <strong>2,780,066</strong> sector types and, unsurprisingly, by far the most common
is a sector of all zeros which occurs <strong>1,647,906</strong> times across <strong>12,319</strong> (<strong>98.95</strong>%) disks.</p>
<p>Below is a listing of the top 20 sector types and how many disks they appear on.
There is a lot more that could (and will) be done here, including clustering disks based on
a distance metric of how many sector types they have in common.
But for now there are a few things that stand out.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the second and third most common sector types are on so few disks.
It will be worth investigating what those disks are. The all-<code>FF</code> type is also on surprisingly few disks.</p>
<p>It is also interesting that the next eight (as well as two more in the top 20) are of the form:<br />
<code>00 11 XX 00 00 00 00 00...</code><br />
I think I know the reason—more on that soon!</p>
<p>Finally, I’ll point out that most of the remaining top-20 are potentially code and I’ll attempt to disassemble them
in a later post.</p>
