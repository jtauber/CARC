  While there has been digital humanities work on old code, I’m not aware of
  any straight up application of corpus linguistic approaches to its study.
</p>

<p>
  The idea for this project came about when I read a discussion of whether
  <code>LDA</code> was the most common 6502 instruction and it occurred to me that this,
  along with a lot of subtleties, is a very “corpus linguistics” question to
  ask.

  The acronym is a Tolkien reference, “Carc” being a legendary raven from the
  past in <cite>The Hobbit</cite>.

    <h1>Where the Variations in the DOS 3.3 Boot Sector Happen</h1>

      <p>Following on from the previous post,
I started wondering where the different DOS-3.3-style boot sector types diverge so I
constructed the following visualization.</p>
<p>This is just a stacked bar chart with the x-axis representing the number of bytes into the sector
and the bars showing the proportion of disks with identical bytes up until that point.</p>
<p>The brightest bars (at the bottom of the stack) represent the normal DOS 3.3 boot sector and so sudden drops indicate a larger number of disks that diverge from that point.
The biggest drops are labeled with the offset at which they occur.</p>
<p><img src="/CARC/figures/boot_sector.svg"></p>
<p>In a normal DOS 3.3 boot sector, the code runs from <code>01</code> to <code>4C</code>, bytes <code>4D</code> to <code>5C</code> contain a table of data (mapping logical sectors to physical sectors), bytes <code>5D</code> to <code>FC</code> aren’t directly used by the boot process but can be used for DOS patches, and bytes <code>FD</code> to <code>FF</code> are some more data.</p>
<p>The fact a drop happens after <code>4A</code> rather than after <code>4C</code> suggests the final <code>JMP</code> has been changed. I’ll explore the variations in more detail in future posts.</p>
