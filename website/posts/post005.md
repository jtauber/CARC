title: Sector Types in the Apple II Disk Corpus

A regular Apple II floppy disk has 560 sectors of 256 bytes.
Across the 12,450 disks in the current corpus, that’s **6,972,000** sectors.
How many unique sector **types** are there and what are the most common?

There are **2,780,066** sector types and, unsurprisingly, by far the most common
is a sector of all zeros which occurs **1,647,906** times across **12,319** (**98.95**%) disks.

Below is a listing of the top 20 sector types and how many disks they appear on.
There is a lot more that could (and will) be done here, including clustering disks based on
a distance metric of how many sector types they have in common.
But for now there are few things that stand out.

It is interesting that the second and third most common sector types are on so few disks.
It will be worth investigating what those disks are. The all-`FF` type is also on surprisingly few disks.

It is also interesting that the next eight (as well as two more in the top 20) are of the form:  
`00 11 XX 00 00 00 00 00...`  
I think I know the reason—more on that soon!

Finally, I’ll point out that most of the remaining top-20 are potentially code and I’ll attempt to disassemble them
in a later post.
