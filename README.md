# CARC
Corpus Analysis of Retro Code

## Background

While there has been digital humanities work on old code, I'm not aware of any straight up application of corpus linguistic approaches to its study.

The idea for this project came about when I read a discussion of whether `LDA` was the most common 6502 instruction and it occurred to me that this, along with a lot of subtleties, is a very "corpus linguistics" question to ask.

The acronym is a Tolkien reference, "Carc" being a legendary raven from the past in _The Hobbit_.

## Initial Scope

- 6502 machine code

## First Steps

- build a corpus of 6502 machine code with useful metadata
